# Beeple Code of Conduct

This is not meant to be rules but more so, examples or guidelines.

---

## Assume good faith
{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

I treat other Beeple with good faith, even when I think they are not responding to me in kind, unless they are unequivocally advocating for hate or intolerance of fellow humans.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

I give others the benefit of a doubt when I read their posts/comments, I assume good intent and give others the opportunity to save face/clarify.

## Report content
{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

When I see posts or comments that I think are not nice, I report them.
{{< /hint >}}

## Tell others when you want to disengage / respect when others want to disengage. 
{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

When I feel that the person I'm talking to is frustrated or I am frustrated, I try to disengage with the conversation.

{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

When someone tells me to stop engaging with them, I disengage from the conversation.

## Respect mod requests and explain how I'm feeling

{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

If a moderator or an admin steps in and requests me to disengage with a user or a topic, I will not fight the request. I may explain how I am feeling about this interaction to the moderator or admin, but I will not be confrontational with the moderator or admin.
{{< /hint >}}
{{< hint danger >}}
**BAD**

If a moderator or an admin steps in and requests me to disengage with a user or a topic, I fight the request, continue escalating the tensions or go in another thread to continue.
{{< /hint >}}

## Make concerns known in the right places
{{< hint info >}}
**GOOD**

If I have concerns about a specific moderator or admin at Beehaw, I raise these concerns in the Beehaw support community and not diffusely across the site or anywhere Beehaw is federated with.
